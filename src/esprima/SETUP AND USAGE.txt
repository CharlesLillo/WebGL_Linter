Very easy setup to run this:

If you don't already have git bash and node installed, go get them. Once they are setup, run -

npm install esprima
npm install estraverse

Now you will be able to run the files.

USAGE OF ANALYZER -

node [analysis file name] [file to be analyzed];

eg. node analysis.js test.js

Console output will provide analysis results.
